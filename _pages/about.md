> Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.
> —— Edsger Dijkstra

In a quest to learn how to use the "telescope" and explore the "universe" during my undergraduate studies, I delved into multiple areas of computer science while adopting various identities. 
These roles included working as 
- a backend developer in the field of computer engineering, 
- a game developer in the field of computer graphics/geometry processing, and
- a researcher in the field of crypto/Web3.

I find it exciting that our world is changing so rapidly, bringing new problems to identify and solve. I am incredibly thankful to my teammates and professors, and I enjoy applying theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems.

Over the past few years, I have gained valuable work and research experience, as well as developed my leadership skills. If you are interested in collaborating after reviewing my CV, please feel free to reach out via email!

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
